in laravel u can easily set up the foreign keys with in the migration: 
$table->foreign('product_id')
  ->references('id')->on('products')
  ->onDelete('cascade')
  ->onUpdate('cascade');
  
$table->foreignId('user1_id')->constrained('user');
you also can easily make a delete and create function like:
for the web: 
Route::get('products/{product}/delete', 'ProductController@delete')
  ->name('products.delete');
in the controller u need to make a new function called delete.
the form method is @method('DELETE')
the action is products.destroy
and in the destroy function 
its like 
$product->delete();
return redirect()->route('products.index');
